            <h1>About this page</h1>
            <p>
                Children have a notoriously short attention span and are known to lose interest in anything less than
                captivating in a matter of minutes. This is why conventional teaching methods don’t work well with
                little ones.

            </p>
            <p>
                They don’t respond well to getting spoken to endlessly and asked to do task after task. That is why
                interactive games for children are one of the best ways to teach young students. They are a great way to
                keep lessons fun and interesting.

            </p>
            <p>
                Not only are they an excellent way to keep your children engaged with their lessons – but it also comes
                with a whole host of other benefits for young children. They help to develop the necessary skills for
                the next year at school while providing a wonderful source of excitement and entertainment.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are just some of the benefits of interactive games for children that should encourage you to use
                them in your home
            </p>

            <p>One of the best things about interactive games is that it often requires children to work with their
                hands or bodies in some way. This is particularly important for toddlers or kindergarten children
                developing their motor skills.</p>
            <p>Another wonderful benefit of interactive games for children is helping them to develop their social
                skills. Games often require teamwork and teaches children to work together, cooperate and learn to trust
                one another.</p>
            <p>One of the most important things in life is having a solid friendship base, and learning how to interact
                and form relationships is an essential skill for little ones to develop.
                Interactive games help children to work out how to gracefully accept both losing and winning, they form
                a sense of sportsmanship and discipline. It provides a platform to teach them how to interact with both
                adults and children – learning how to successfully form relationships as they go.</p>
